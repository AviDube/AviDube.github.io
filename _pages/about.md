## Information

Hello my name is Avi Dube! I am currently a student at Purdue University majoring in Computer Engineering. My focus is mostly in Control Systems, Machine Learning, and Automation. I am working on breaking edge technology using simulations to test control systems and integrating neural networks and reinforcement learning into control systems.

I am fluent in C++, Python, MatLab, C and know Java and HTML. I also learned and applied the theory of PID, Motion Profiling, Odometery, and RRT control algorithms in drones and robots. 

I am the Lead Researcher of Drone SWARMS at Purdue University under Professor Sundaram developing an easy-to-use, scalable, web-based multi-agent drone simulation platform. 

My hobbies include playing basketball, modifying cars, and just having a good time with friends.
