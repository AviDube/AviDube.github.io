# Introduction
Videos and pictures of my autonomous routines and robots over the 4 year period I competed in VEX Robotics as team 1961Z.

# Simulation Platform
This project was an attempt to create a simulated environment in Unity to help train a machine learning algorithm. Then to port this algorithm into our competition robot and see how it would react. While I was not able to finish this project as I transitioned to college this was my stepping point into the research that I work on now with Drone SWARMS and how they are simulated.

# The Years

## Change Up 2020 - 2021
Change Up was one of the best years we had as a team we all took the culmination of failures and success over the years and built / coded a robot that show cased that learning.
