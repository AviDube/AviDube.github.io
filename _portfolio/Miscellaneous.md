# Introduction
This is just a collection of projects that I worked on that don't fit under a main category. Mostly were either class projects or videos I posted for the robotics community.

# Projects
## Youtube Videos
For robotics I created a video series for beginners to learn robotics coding. This way they don't have to struggle like I did in robotics when I couldn't find any resources online.

## This website
This website was another project I started on to showcase my portfolio for interviewers to see the projects I have worked on.

## Typing Test
This was a project I worked on for my Engr 133 class that I have to take during my freshmen year. For the individual project I created a typing test for me to practice my own typing skills and to improve from it. I programmed it in python and it took me 2 days to build the backend and another day to get the gui to work.

How the gui/user interface looked when someone would be practicing their typing.

The results screen the user would see once done with the typing test.
